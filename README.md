# Generative-Adversarial-Networks-GANs-Lab-Notes
About GANs Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful machine learning models capable of generating realistic image, video, and voice outputs.   Rooted in game theory, GANs have wide-spread application: from improving cybersecurity by fighting against adversarial attacks and anonymizing data to preserve privacy to generating state-of-the-art images, colorizing black and white images, increasing image resolution, creating avatars, turning 2D images to 3D, and more.
